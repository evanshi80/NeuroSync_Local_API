# NeuroSync Local API

## Overview

The **NeuroSync Local API** allows you to host the audio-to-face blendshape transformer model locally. This API processes audio data and outputs facial blendshape coefficients, which can be streamed directly to Unreal Engine using the **NeuroSync Player** and LiveLink.

### Features:
- Host the model locally for full control
- Process audio files and generate facial blendshapes

## NeuroSync Model

To generate the blendshapes, you can:

- [Download the model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/AnimaVR/NEUROSYNC_Audio_To_Face_Blendshape)

## Player Requirement

To stream the generated blendshapes into Unreal Engine, you will need the **NeuroSync Player**. The Player allows for real-time integration with Unreal Engine via LiveLink. 

You can find the NeuroSync Player and instructions on setting it up here:
